_A stalker of [IP cameras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_camera)_

**What is this?**

A high performance web proxy for serving [MJPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG) streams to the masses.

Background

**IP cameras can't handle web traffic**

IP cameras are slow devices that can't handle a regular amount of web traffic. So if you plan to go public with an IP camera you have the following options:

1. **The naive approach** - Embed the camera service directly in your site, e.g. http://201.166.63.44/axis-cgi/jpg/image.cgi?resolution=CIF.
2. **Ye olde approach** - Serve images as static files in your server. I've found that several sites use this approach through messy PHP background jobs that update this files at slow intervals, generating excessive (and unnecessary) disk accesses.
3. **Plug n' pray approach** - Embed a flash or Java-based player, such as the  [Cambozola](http://www.charliemouse.com/code/cambozola/) player. This requires plugins.
4. **MJPG proxy** - Serve the MJPG stream directly if you are targeting only grade A browsers, (sorry IE).
5. **Paparazzo.js: A web service of dynamic images** - Build a MJPG proxy server which parses the stream, updates images in memory, and delivers new images on demand. I've found that this approach is scalable, elegant, blazing fast and doesn't require disk access.

Usage

**Server side**

	# Initialize
	
	# Same parameters as http.get http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.0/api/http.html#http.get
	p = new Paparazzo 
			host: 'your-camera.dyndns.org'
			port: 80
		, (err) ->
			console.log err.message
	p.start
	
	# Update image
	
	updatedImage = ''
	p.on 'update', (image) -> 
		updatedImage = image		
	p.on 'error', (error) ->
		console.log err.message
		
	# Serve image
	
	http = require 'http'
	url = require 'url'
	path = url.parse(req.url).pathname
	
	http.createServer (req, res) -> 
		data = ''
		if path == '/camera' and updatedImage?
			data = updatedImage
		
		res.writeHead 200, 
			'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg'
			'Content-Length': data.length

		res.write data, 'binary'
		res.end()
	.listen(3000)
		

**Client side**

You can simulate MJPG streaming by requesting new images on a specific interval. Appending a random parameter avoids caching.

	// JavaScript example using jQuery

	// Active camera will refresh every 2 seconds
	var TIMEOUT = 2000;
	var refreshInterval = setInterval(function() {
		var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.pow(2, 31));
		$('img#camera').attr('src', 'http://localhost:3000/camera?i=' + Math.random());
	}, TIMEOUT);	


	<!-- In your HTML output -->
	<img src='' id='camera' />
